  <p>About me:</p>
  <p>My name is Liam Pennie. I attended Niskayuna High School in Niskayuna, New York, and lived there for my entire childhood. Some hobbies I enjoy include playing video games, such as Rainbow Six: Siege and Civilization V; programming in C#, Rust, or another language; listening to music, such as $uicideboy$ or Skrillex; and watching television shows, such as The 100 or Marvel's Agents of SHIELD. I am currently 18 years old and look forward to my years at college!</p>
